# Comp Graphic and Visualization

  Working on this project has helped me develop skills in designing 3D scenes, as well as
understanding how to structure and organize code for rendering and interaction.
  The design process that I followed was very iterative, as I was able to implement
things in the project as I learned new concepts. I was able to break down my objects
into simple shapes, figure out how to draw them, add colors to the objects, replace
the colors with textures, add lighting with the Phong lighting model, and introduce
normals to my surfaces.
  Designing software involves understanding user needs, planning, and structuring code
for maintainability and scalability. These skills can be applied in future projects by
ensuring clear requirements, thoughtful architecture, and a user-friendly interface.

  Working on a 3D scene in OpenGL introduced me to strategies for optimizing rendering performance,
such as omitting portions of the objects that will never be seen and therefore need not be
drawn. I also learned to implement shaders and learned a bit about creating and manipulating
matrices. I also learned techniques for handling user input in a 3D environment.
  Iteration is crucial in software development, allowing me to refine and improve my code. This 
involved tweaking shaders for better visual effects, inching objects into their final rotation and 
positioning, and making sure the lighting and reflective surfaces were just right.
  My approach to code development certainly evolved as I encountered challenges and milestones.
I started with a basic rendering setup and iteratively added features, optimized code, and 
improved the overall structure to meet project goals.

  Computational graphics and visualizations provide practical applications of computer science concepts.
Understanding the principles of rendering, shading, and interaction has deepened my knowledge in
computer graphics. This knowledge is foundational for pursuing advanced topics in graphics programming
or related fields during my educational journey.
  In a professional context, skills in computational graphics and visualizations open doors to careers
in game development, virtual reality, simulation, and other graphics-intensive industries. Proficiency
in OpenGL or similar graphics APIs is valuable in roles related to graphics programming, software
development, and computer-aided design.
